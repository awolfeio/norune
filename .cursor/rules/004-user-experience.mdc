## Core Principles
- Evoke Dark Cloud nostalgia with a warm, playful interface while grounding every flow in clarity and trust.
- Communicate wallet-connected identity at all times; players must know when actions are on-chain, cached, or pending.
- Craft interactions that feel welcoming to both crypto newcomers and veterans, minimizing jargon and surprise.

## Onboarding & Identity
- Surface the `Connect with Phantom` CTA immediately, with a secondary "Explore in Spectator Mode" option for read-only browsing.
- After wallet connection, present a username picker bound to the wallet signature; validate uniqueness and display the binding summary.
- Persist onboarding progress so reloading mid-flow resumes at the last completed step.
- Provide context links explaining wallet safety, state permanence, and how usernames map to Solana accounts.

## Tutorial Experience
- Launch a paginated tutorial modal on first login, covering wallet safety, world overview, camera controls, and avatar mode.
- Allow players to skip or revisit the tutorial from a `Guidebook` control; log completion state per wallet.
- Each tutorial page should combine short copy (<= 120 chars) with illustrative visuals or mini-clips.
- Include call-to-action buttons that trigger guided UI highlights (spotlight overlay) when closing the tutorial.

## World Overview
- Introduce the 512x512 plot with a labeled HUD overlay showing grid coordinates, biome, and resource summaries.
- Display an unobtrusive grid toggle to help visualize placement without overwhelming the scene aesthetics.
- Offer quick tips on how the grid supports future building, farming, waterways, and ornaments.
- Provide accessible text descriptions for the plot layout so screen readers narrate key terrain features.

## Camera & Navigation
- Default to an aerial, slightly isometric camera that orbits the plot center while clamped above ground to prevent subterranean views.
- Support smooth drag or right-stick orbiting with dampened easing; expose keyboard bindings (Q/E) for rotational nudge.
- Integrate pinch/scroll zoom with bounds that maintain context; show a minimap inset when zooming close.
- Surface a "Reset Camera" command that snaps back to default framing without disorienting animations when reduce-motion is enabled.

## Avatar Possession Mode
- Provide a Street Viewâ€“style drag-and-drop entry: dragging the avatar icon onto the grid transitions from aerial to ground-level view.
- Animate the swap with a brief dissolve and maintain orientation continuity so the avatar spawns facing the dropped location.
- Control the avatar with WASD (or analog stick), with Space for interaction prompts and Shift for contextual sprint if available.
- Present unobtrusive HUD indicators for controls, stamina (if applicable), and exit-to-orbit button.
- Sync avatar state with Solana gameplay data so position, inventory, and interaction logs remain consistent between modes.
